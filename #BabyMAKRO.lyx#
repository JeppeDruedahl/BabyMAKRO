\begin_layout Abstract
This note outlines a simplified 
\begin_inset Quotes ald

baby
\begin_inset Quotes ard
\end_inset

 version of the MAKRO model used by the Danish Ministry of Finance.
 The model is for a small open economy with a fixed exchange and overlapping
 generations.
 The model have perfect foresight, but is full of imperfections due to e.g.
 frictions in the labor market and adjustment costs.
 The model is written and solved in terms of a series of ordered blocks.
 This clarifies the model dynamics and make it easier to solve for fluctuations
 around the steady state using a numerical equation system solver.
 Online code is provided for solving the model in Python.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
The model is designed so undergraduate students can work with it, and analyze
 potential extensions in their thesis work.
 The model structure is similar to state-of-the-art heterogeneous agent
 models (see this 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "course"
target "https://sites.google.com/view/numeconcph-advmacrohet/"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) and the model is thus relevant for further academic studies.
 The similarity to the grown-up MAKRO model make it relevant for potential
 future job tasks and the public debate.

\begin_layout Abstract
The note concludes with a status report on the continuing development of
 the model.

\begin_layout Standard
We consider a 
\emph on
small open economy
\emph default
 with a 
\emph on
fixed exchange rate
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
overlapping generations
\emph default
.
 Time is discrete, 
\begin_inset Formula $t\in\{0,1,\dots\}$
\end_inset

 and the frequency is annual.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Households
\emph default
 live for up to 
\begin_inset Formula $\#$
\end_inset

 periods, and their age is denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

.
 The age dependent mortality is 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta_{a}\in(0,1)$
\end_inset

 and the population and demographic structure is constant.
 Households exogenously search for jobs and supply labor, receive inheritances
 and choose consumption and savings to get utility from consumption and
 bequests.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
foreign economy
\emph default
 provides a fixed nominal rate of return, sell import goods at fixed prices,
 and have a demand curve for the domestic export good.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
production
\emph default
 in the economy is layered as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\emph on
Production firms
\emph default
 rent
\emph on
 capital
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
labor
\emph default
 to produce the domestic output good.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\emph on
Repacking firms
\emph default
 combine imported goods with the domestic output good to produce a consumption
 good, an investment good, and an export good.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Capital is rented from a 
\emph on
capital agency
\emph default
, which purchases the investment good to accumulate capital subject to adjustmen
t costs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Labor is rented from a 
\emph on
labor agency
\emph default
, which post vacancies a search-and-match labor market to purchase labor
 from the households.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All firms are price takers.
 Prices are thus flexible, except for wages which is determined by ad hoc
 bargaining.
 All 
\emph on
goods markets clear
\emph default
 and the matching process is determined by a 
\emph on
matching function
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is 
\emph on
perfect foresight
\emph default
 in the economy.
 I.e.
 the value of all current and future variables are known.
 This is a strong assumption, and in many ways the model should be considered
 a first order approximation to a full model with both idiosyncratic and
 aggregate risk.
 It can be relevant to introduce model elements, which proxy for the effects
 of risks.
 Utility-of-wealth can e.g.
 proxy for a precautionary saving motive.

\begin_layout Subsection
Equilibrium path
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:Equilibrium-path"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
equilibrium path
\emph default
 in the economy is a set of paths for all variables, which satisfies all
 accounting identities, optimal firm and household behavior in terms of
 first order conditions, and implies market clearing.
 When all variables are constant over time, the equilibrium path is a 
\emph on
steady state
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In terms of math, the model is just an 
\emph on
equation system
\emph default
 stacking the accounting identifies, first order conditions and market clearing
 conditions.
 If the economy is initially out of steady state, we solve for the equilibrium
 path by truncating the equation system to 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 periods.
 The assumption is that the economy has settled down to the steady state
 well before period 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

, and we can assume variables from period 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 onward are at their steady state value.
 The economy can be out of steady state both because lagged 
\emph on
endogenous 
\emph default
variables are initially not at their steady state values and/or because
 the 
\emph on
exogenous
\emph default
 variables are not at their steady state values.
 We talk of an 
\emph on
impulse response
\emph default
 when the economy starts at the steady state, but some exogenous variables
 
\emph on
temporarily
\emph default
 deviate from the steady state following some converging auto-regressive
 process.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is also called an MIT shock.
 A shock in a model with perfect foresight is to some degree a contradiction
 in terms.
 The assumption is that even though the agents experiences a shock, they
 expect that there will never be a shock again.
 Accounting for expecting of future shocks is much more complicated.
 Some realism can be mimicked by studying impulse response to shocks about
 the future, which when the future comes never materialized as a new opposite
 signed shock negates it.
 Multiple shocks arriving sequentially can also be studied.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We simplify the model and the resulting equation system by writing it in
 terms of a 
\emph on
ordered series of block
\emph default
.
 We start from a set of 
\emph on
exogenous 
\emph default
variables (e.g.
 variables determined in the foreign economy) and a set of 
\emph on
unknown
\emph default
 variables.
 Each block then takes in the path of some variables, return the path of
 other variables, and imply 
\emph on
targets
\emph default
, which must be zero if the model equations are satisfied.
 Each block can use the unknown variables and output variables of previous
 blocks as input variables.
 In the end we collect all the targets.
 The 
\emph on
number of unknown variables
\emph default
 must equal the 
\emph on
number of target variables
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To solve the model, we must first find the steady state.
 As explained in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Steady-state"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, this can be done by manually choosing values for a selection of the endogenous
 variables and the deriving the rest from closed form expressions or solving
 sub-systems with a numerical equation system solver.
 Next, we solve for the equilibrium path again using a numerical equation
 system solver.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The block structure and ordering is 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 unique.
 If a different set of unknowns is chosen, a different ordering of blocks
 must also be chosen.
 If an additional variable is considered an 
\emph on
unknown, 
\emph default
an additional equation must be considered a target instead of being used
 to calculate a output.
 In the limit, all variables can be considered as unknowns and all equations
 as targets.
 This is inefficient as the number of variables can be very large.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Modeling systems such as GAMS can combined with a state-of-the-art solver
 such as CONOOPT automatically analyze the structure of the equation system
 and thereby ripe the benefits we get from manually ordering the blocks.

On CES technology
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:On-CES-technology"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The assumption of CES technology is used repeatedly in the model.
 It is therefore beneficial to recap it briefly.
 Consider a firm producing good 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 using good 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{j}$
\end_inset

 with a CES technology.
 Input prices are 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{j}$
\end_inset

 and the output price is 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

.
 The firm is a price taker in all markets.
 The 
\emph on
profit maximization
\emph default
 problem of the firm is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\max_{X_{i},X_{j}}PX-P_{i}X_{i}-P_{j}X_{j}\text{ s.t. }X=\Gamma\left(\mu_{i}^{\frac{1}{\sigma}}X_{i}^{\frac{\sigma-1}{\sigma}}+\mu_{j}^{\frac{1}{\sigma}}X_{j}^{\frac{\sigma-1}{\sigma}}\right)^{\frac{\sigma}{\sigma-1}},\,\,\,\mu_{i}+\mu_{j}=1,\,\mu_{i},\sigma,\Gamma>0,\,\sigma\neq1\label{eq:CES}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The generic 
\emph on
first order condition
\emph default

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
0 & =P\mu_{i}^{\frac{1}{\sigma}}X_{i}^{\frac{\sigma-1}{\sigma}-1}\Gamma\left(\mu_{i}^{\frac{1}{\sigma}}X_{i}^{\frac{\sigma-1}{\sigma}}+\mu_{j}^{\frac{1}{\sigma}}X_{j}^{\frac{\sigma-1}{\sigma}}\right)^{\frac{\sigma}{\sigma-1}-1}-P_{i}\Leftrightarrow\nonumber \\
P_{i} & =P\mu_{i}^{\frac{1}{\sigma}}X_{i}^{-\frac{1}{\sigma}}\Gamma\left(\mu_{i}^{\frac{1}{\sigma}}X_{i}^{\frac{\sigma-1}{\sigma}}+\mu_{j}^{\frac{1}{\sigma}}X_{j}^{\frac{\sigma-1}{\sigma}}\right)^{\frac{1}{\sigma-1}}\Leftrightarrow\nonumber \\
P_{i} & =P\mu_{i}^{\frac{1}{\sigma}}X_{i}^{-\frac{1}{\sigma}}\Gamma^{\frac{\sigma-1}{\sigma}}X^{\frac{1}{\sigma}}\Leftrightarrow\nonumber \\
X_{i} & =\mu_{i}\left(\frac{P}{P_{i}}\right)^{\sigma}\Gamma^{\sigma-1}X.\label{eq:CES_FOC_i}
\end{align}

\end_inset

As the production technology has constant return-to-scale, there are infinitely
 many solutions to the FOCs.
 They all satisfy that inputs are used in proportion as follows
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{X_{i}}{X_{j}}=\frac{\mu_{i}}{\mu_{j}}\left(\frac{P_{j}}{P_{i}}\right)^{\sigma}\label{eq:FOCs_combined}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Assuming 
\emph on
free entry
\emph default
, and thus 
\emph on
zero profits
\emph default
, the output price is uniquely determined from the input prices as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
0 & =PX-P_{i}X_{i}-P_{j}X_{j}\Leftrightarrow\nonumber \\
P & =\frac{P_{i}X_{i}+P_{j}X_{j}}{X}\nonumber \\
 & =\mu_{i}\left(\frac{P}{P_{i}}\right)^{\sigma}\Gamma^{\sigma-1}P_{i}+\mu_{j}\left(\frac{P}{P_{j}}\right)^{\sigma}\Gamma^{\sigma-1}P_{j}\Leftrightarrow\nonumber \\
\left(\Gamma P\right)^{1-\sigma} & =\mu_{i}P_{i}^{1-\sigma}+\mu_{j}P_{j}^{1-\sigma}\Leftrightarrow\nonumber \\
P & =\frac{1}{\Gamma}\left(\mu_{i}P_{i}^{1-\sigma}+\mu_{j}P_{j}^{1-\sigma}\right)^{\frac{1}{1-\sigma}}.\label{eq:CES_P}

 This makes the capital more productive,

 The marginal cost price increases,

 As the output prices are sticky, the increase should be relatively smaller.
 The effect on capital is ambiguous.

 which leads to a large drop in consumption.
 The Ricardian households have foreseen this new tax rate, such that their
 consumption is more even throughout the period, but still with a decrease
 in consumption once the higher tax rate is implemented.
 They achieve the consumption smoothing by increasing their savings under
 the lower tax rate, and using this additional savings/income once the high
 tax rate is implemented.
 The bequests will not reach much before the new tax rate is implemented,
 because that a high proportion of the population made their savings decision
 before the shock to government consumption, and they will not/only partly
 be affected by a higher tax in the future.
 However, the higher tax rate has a larger effect on the later generation,

 The import grow due to the declining import prices.
 As the import prices declines faster than the domestic prices, the import

 remains high.
 However, the growth in the debt is limited due to a decrease in the interest
 payments following the initial drop in debt.
 The debt continues to increase above its steady state level following the
 higher unemployment rate, and the converges once the unemployment converges

Initial effect
\series default
: Again, the two shock channels have different effects on consumption.
 From the foreign demand shock channel, higher foreign demand implies more
 labor, a lower tax rate and thereby a higher real income for the households,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{inc}^{\text{real}}\uparrow$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, both HtM and Ricardian households increase consumption, 
\begin_inset Formula $C\uparrow$
\end_inset

.
 The Ricardian household consumption smooths by initially increase their
 savings, 
\begin_inset Formula $A\uparrow$
\end_inset

, as they foresee that the tax rate will increase in the future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The price shock channel implies less import and thereby less consumption
 import.
 Additionally, the real income of the household decreases as the effects
 on the labor supply is significantly smaller combined with the fact that
 the real unemployment and retirement benefits decreases.
 Both of these effects suggest lower consumption, 
\begin_inset Formula $C\downarrow$
\end_inset

.
 The initial price shock implies future deflation, and thereby an increase
 in the real interest rate, 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{inc}^{\text{real}}\uparrow$
\end_inset

.
 As such, Ricardian households substitute towards savings, 
\begin_inset Formula $A\uparrow$
\end_inset

, which also implies they consume less than the HtM households initially.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The combined effect of both channels suggests an increase in both the real
 interest rate and savings.
 The effect on consumption and real income is ambiguous, but the overall
 effect is a reduction in both.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Transition path
\series default
: Taking a starting point in the foreign demand shock, the real income continues
 to rise due to a lower tax rate.
 This allows for more consumption as well as more savings.
 As the savings increase so does the related interest payments, which over
 time allows the Ricardian households to have consumption above their real
 income.
 Once, the tax rate starts converging towards its steady state level, so
 does the real income and thereby the consumption.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Turning to the price shock channel, the real interest decreases from its
 initial high level, which induces the Ricardian households to save up less
 than initially, thus consuming more.
 The higher interest payment allows the Ricardian household to increase
 consumption even though the real income continues to decline due to an
 increase in the tax rate.
 Eventually, the real interest rate has decreased too much for the interest
 payment to be sufficient to cover the excess consumption (consumption above
 the real wage), thus the Ricardian households start to use their savings
 to cover their consumption.
 Once, the real income converges, so will the consumption and the savings.

Initial effect
\series default
: Initially, there is a shock to the interest rate, 
\begin_inset Formula $r^{hh}\uparrow$
\end_inset

.
 This has two effects on the Ricardian households' savings - namely an income
 and a substitution effect.
 The income effect is an increase return on savings already held by the
 households.
 As such, they can reach the same savings level even if they decrease future
 savings.
 Overall, this income effect implies that the consumption would initially
 increase.
 The substitution effect is that the interest rate for future savings are
 higher.
 This makes it more attractive to build up savings, which implies an initial
 drop in consumption.
 Overall, the substitution effect seems to be dominant as consumption for
 the Ricardian households initially decreases, 
\begin_inset Formula $C^{R}\downarrow$
\end_inset

, and savings increases, 
\begin_inset Formula $A\uparrow$
\end_inset

.
 A lower demand for consumption drives down the price on consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $P^{C}\downarrow$
\end_inset

, such that the Hands-to-Mouth households can afford more consumption, 
\begin_inset Formula $C^{HtM}\uparrow$
\end_inset

 The effect on total consumption is a decrease, 
\begin_inset Formula $C\downarrow$

 Notably, there is an initial increase in bequests, as these are affected
 by the interest rate 
\begin_inset Formula $Aq\uparrow$

\begin_inset Newline newline

\series bold
Transition path
\series default
: After the initial drop, the Ricardians' consumption increases as they
 save less.
 Higher demand drives up prices on demand, which in isolation should make
 consumption converge towards its steady state level.
 However, higher demand also implies higher output levels and thereby higher
 employment levels.
 This has two positive effects for consumption; higher income and less tax
 payments.
 These two effects also affects the Hands-to Mouth households' consumption,
 and they imply that the total consumption is above it steady state level
 for a long period.
 Eventually, the higher prices ensures that the consumption converge back
 to its steady state level.
 The effects on savings are similar, and these are above their steady state
 level as well.

 The output price is sticky, thus the decrease is relatively smaller.
 A lower output price implies that the price on investment also decreases,

 The investments are affected by the decrease in the return on capital relative
 to the decrease in the price on investment.
